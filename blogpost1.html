                    <p class="blog-post_text">Learn how these veterinarian procedures can positively impact the general health and welfare of animals in the community and help reduce the number of unwanted animals that find themselves on the streets and in shelters. </p>

                    <p class="blog-post_text">Is your pet spayed or neutered? If not, we’re here to help you understand why it is so important and encourage you to consider taking that next step. There are so many positive outcomes when it comes to spaying and neutering your pets. Let us walk you through all the ways that it can benefit your pet, the community, and you.  </p>
                    <h3>Improve the health and well-being of animals</h3>
                    <p class="blog-post_text">Pets that have not been spayed or neutered are at an increased risk of contracting diseases, getting infections, or developing certain types of cancer that could potentially be life-threatening (ASPCA, 2015). Pets are part of the family. We should treat them as such by making their health a priority, too. </p>
                    <p class="blog-post_text">When it comes to male pets, getting them neutered can help prevent testicular and prostate cancers. Getting female pets spayed can help prevent uterine infections and cancerous breast tumors. </p>
                    <p class="blog-post_text">Not only do the medical issues described impact the life expectancy and quality of life of beloved fur friends, they also generally mean costly vet bills for their owners. As a pet owner, investing in this minimally invasive and humane procedure for your pet could ultimately save you money in the long run and save your pet’s life.</p>
                    <p class="blog-post_text">The earlier you get animals spayed/neutered the more effective it is and the faster the recovery will be for them. Animals can generally undergo the procedure when they are at least 8 weeks of age. Some vets will not spay or neuter until 4 months. Consult a spay/neuter clinic or veterinarian in your area for further guidance. </p>
                    <h3>Lower the risk of certain behavioral problems</h3>
                    <p class="blog-post_text">Getting pets spayed and neutered can often reduce the likelihood that certain behavioral problems will develop. You may have heard that female cats in heat frequently yowl and urinate. This can become a problem when they are urinating in places they aren’t supposed to… like your couch or carpet. Male cats and dogs also have a tendency to urinate in unwanted places when they are marking their territory. Trust us when we say you don’t want them spraying all over your walls and furniture. The stench is potent. Neutering can help alleviate these behaviors. It can also lower the risk of your male cat or dog wandering away from home to find a mate or developing aggressive behavior (ASPCA, 2015).</p>
                    <p class="blog-post_text">It’s important to note, that spaying and neutering isn’t a sure fix. Animal behaviors are dependent upon many factors and while neutering does reduce testosterone it doesn’t eliminate it and it won’t undo learned or habitual behaviors. </p>
                    <p class="blog-post_text">Check out our blog post, <a href="#"><strong>How to Train Your Fur Friends</strong></a>, for tips and tricks on raising well-behaved pets. </p>
                    <h3 class="blog-post1_heading-3">Reduce overpopulation of unwanted animals</h3>
                    <div class="blog-post_img">
                        <img src="images/blogpost1_img2.jpeg" alt="Veterinarian and pet owner with dachshund in a vet office">
                    </div>
                    <p class="blog-post_text">While all of the reasons we have listed here are important, this is the one we are most passionate about advocating for. Spaying and neutering prevent unplanned, and in most cases, unwanted pregnancies that bring many animals into our world who end up abandoned and/or euthanized. Every year there are millions of animals that needlessly face euthanasia simply because there aren’t enough homes for them. Spay and neuter procedures allow for necessary population control. This is not only good for the livelihood of all animals, but it is also good for the environment and our communities in general. Stray animals can sometimes pose a threat to ecosystems in our communities and to the people living in them.</p>
                    <p class="blog-post_text">Overall, spay and neuter procedures provide numerous health benefits for pets and protect animals from being put up for adoption. The bottom line is that these services save lives.</p>
                    <p class="blog-post_text">While these procedures can help your pet immensely, please note that they don’t guarantee that your pet won’t still experience health problems or behavioral issues. Remember, we are your ally and we are here to support you. If you need to get your pet spayed or neutered, here are a few resources to support you on your journey. </p>
